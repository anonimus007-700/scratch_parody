We all know Scratch and this is a parody of it.

## How to work in a parody

To start making your program, you need to place other blocks under the red block in turn.

A block can be created only once!

## How to launch a parody

required libraries:
* tkinter

You need to enter the `src` folder and run main.py

## In addition

The program is open source, that is, blocks can be added by analogy to others.

enjoy :thumbsup:
